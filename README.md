# WebApplication Development Tree - Jason
Should only be modified by identified party

This is the development version of the WebApplication for the Compendium. 

Downloading the folder in its entirety, while keeping the same names of the folders and files, will allow the user to open the development version of the WebApp in Rstudio.

The web application does not allow modifying the dataset, only querying it.
