# Web Application (Read-on) - Jason
Should only be modified by identified party

This will be the master version of the code which should only be modified by the identified party. The identified party will be named in the Repository.

Downloading the folder in its entirety, while keeping the same names of the folders and files, will allow the user to open the read-only version of the app in Rstudio.

The full version does not allow modification of the .sqlite file through the application, either by adding new cases or by modifying existing cases.
